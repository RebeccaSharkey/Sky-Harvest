# Sky Harvest

### Collab game created in Unity

Sky Harvest was created as part of my third year group project. I was one of the three programmers for the project and was in charge of creating the majority of important UI mechanics, such as the Inventory system and shops, which included producing the UI that the player would see and making it as intuitive as possible so the user didn't have to learn anything new and would simply know how to use their inventory, shops, weekly tasks, silos and other important UI such as game guide and aquarium. Not only this I worked on making all these work correctly in the backend of the game as well as made sure everything was saved correctly, meaning that the user would be able to use or sell/buy anything they harvested or collected throughout the gameplay experience.
